**Data Practices**

For the specific given task, the wealth of nations data being used here has been approved to be used in an open-source format across projects, conducting a filtering and analysis of the GDP gained for the given countries in the source. The data that I worked with across this project also met the guidelines given that the identities of those who provided the data, and their sensitive information was managed with care. The data is not used for anything more than providing an Excel analysis of the GDP across countries in terms of wealth to produce a data visualisation report for a GITHUB project using Tableau, therefore is complies with the policies and procedures highlighted in the Data Protection Act. The data is being used by multiple students training on the bootcamp I took part in to create this data visualisation and should this data be changed and removed from public access, we would no longer be doing work with the data.

On a closing note, I also searched what procedural practices would be best as an analyst, part of the procedures includes making sure the data we are using is presented and collated in a format that reflects good data quality. General presentation of data in procedures should include removing duplicates and errors, and visualisations produced to apply to both a technical and non-technical audience, with accessibility options for audiences who may have visual impairments and other disabilities, making it accessible. This also means using a data processor that is safe to handle the data of the business and client and ensuring that consent is taken from the subject in handling their data. This concludes my research on how employees in the workplace in accordance with law must handle personal, organizational, and business data in accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018, further elaborating on the etiquette and the procedural usage of ensuring the data is presented and handled with care by a data analyst.

                                                                                                                  
This task was beneficial in helping me learn about the GDPR and Data Protection Act in accordance with how the government and the UK law requires data to be handled regarding organisations and companies. 



**Data Cleaning**

**Figure 1 : Taking the wealth of nations dataset for exploratory analysis, the first task was to scrub the data clean and filter it so that we have the information in the dataset that we want to work with, completed on Microsoft Excel, the task also involved us creating three automated macros for the data and a visual bar graph to show the Top 20 Highest ranking countries in GDP for the countries in 2019**


**Task Automation : Creating Macros**

**Figure 2 : Working with data requires a lot of tasks to be complete at a fast pace, solution? Use Macros, by adding functionality to the Excel Spreadsheet, I can now assign commands using the macros function to save, print or copy the file.**

**Creating a Tableau Dashboard for a Colour Blind Client**

The final stage of the task put my Tableau skills to use. I was challenged to research the correct colour scheme for the client so that the dashboard would look appealing to them. After research I found that red, orange, blue or grey and white colour schemes worked the best since these schemes could easily be identified so opted to use the colour-blind scheme in the Edit Colours section of Tableau. Although for the most part the visualisations were simply me applying the skills, I learnt on the bootcamp, I struggled with the composition of the full dashboard and to fit all the visualisations upon it so that it could be viewed in the aspect ratio. After some research I found that sometimes changing the aspect radio and the view from Entire View to Fit to Height or Fit to Width worked better to have each visualisation fit and after testing both the floating options and the tiled options for the visualisation placements, I eventually found a dashboard view that worked. Another challenge that I came across was due to having such a limited dataset of Top 20 ranking countries with their GDP information, I was unsure how to represent a visual that uniquely identified a different piece of information there without copying the same information being represented in a different visual. 
This is the reason why the filters are all locked on the visual and I opted for more discrete information, splitting my dataset for closer analysis. I chose to analyse the Top 5 of the countries there and their percentages that made up the Top 5, to demonstrate which of the countries were producing the highest percentage of GDPs and the ranks. The bar chart meanwhile produced a general overview with clear data labels of each GDP and country name whilst the map focused on the 5 lowest earners there in the table, which again used the filter function there through the cards that I placed into the filter section there in the options with “Top” there. The final visualisation was a table, with the aggregation of the average GDP across the Top 20 countries there formatted in clear blue that matched and contrasted with red and grey overtones of the visualisation. In the future, I should like to improve the dynamic and interactivity concepts of the dashboard there and find creative methods to analyse and demonstrate visualisations with a limited dataset.
To conclude, I have learned under what policies and procedures an analyst must work under when cleaning and formatting data as well as producing visualisations for clients, the challenges faced when deducing what kind of questions to ask from data and how I can improve upon that aspect and how to create visualisations that are accessible to all, including that with colour blindness in an easy to understand format.
