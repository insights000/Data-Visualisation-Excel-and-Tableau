# Data-Visualisation-Excel-and-Tableau
**Overview**
This task was beneficial in helping me learn about the GDPR and Data Protection Act in accordance with how the government and the UK law requires data to be handled regarding organisations and companies. Furthermore, I learned about the policies and procedures of making sure that the data quality is fit for presentation in the manner of data quality, removal of errors and accessibility for all as seen by the third task where we were asked to create a visualisation for a colour-blind client. 
During the second task some learning points would include applying and increasing my Excel skills of filtering and producing visualisation as well as being able to apply my understanding of Macros throughout the Just IT skills Data Technician Bootcamp and how to automate processes in Excel used in the “Save”, “Print”, and “Copy” section of the task there. 
Admittedly I struggled with the initial first task of fitting 228 countries on a legend into a visualisation, after some experimentation however I managed to create a pivot chart and adjust the sizing so that most of the chart could be viewed. I also then went further and created a heat map to experiment with the different ways that unfiltered data could be used when there were too many countries on the legend, in the future I would hope that I could find an effective manner of representing large sources of information on charts with a limited visual capacity. After sorting and filtering for the Top 20 highest ranking countries of GDP per capita, I produced a visualisation there thereby completing the word part of the task as well, learning how to transfer information from Excel spreadsheets and represent them into different formats for printed use.

The final stage of the task put my Tableau skills to use. I was challenged to research the correct colour scheme for the client so that the dashboard would look appealing to them. After research I found that red, orange, blue or grey and white colour schemes worked the best since these schemes could easily be identified so opted to use the colour-blind scheme in the Edit Colours section of Tableau. Although for the most part the visualisations were simply me applying the skills, I learnt on the bootcamp, I struggled with the composition of the full dashboard and to fit all the visualisations upon it so that it could be viewed in the aspect ratio. After some research I found that sometimes changing the aspect radio and the view from Entire View to Fit to Height or Fit to Width worked better to have each visualisation fit and after testing both the floating options and the tiled options for the visualisation placements, I eventually found a dashboard view that worked. Another challenge that I came across was due to having such a limited dataset of Top 20 ranking countries with their GDP information, I was unsure how to represent a visual that uniquely identified a different piece of information there without copying the same information being represented in a different visual. 
This is the reason why the filters are all locked on the visual and I opted for more discrete information, splitting my dataset for closer analysis. I chose to analyse the Top 5 of the countries there and their percentages that made up the Top 5, to demonstrate which of the countries were producing the highest percentage of GDPs and the ranks. The bar chart meanwhile produced a general overview with clear data labels of each GDP and country name whilst the map focused on the 5 lowest earners there in the table, which again used the filter function there through the cards that I placed into the filter section there in the options with “Top” there. The final visualisation was a table, with the aggregation of the average GDP across the Top 20 countries there formatted in clear blue that matched and contrasted with red and grey overtones of the visualisation. In the future, I should like to improve the dynamic and interactivity concepts of the dashboard there and find creative methods to analyse and demonstrate visualisations with a limited dataset.
To conclude, I have learned under what policies and procedures an analyst must work under when cleaning and formatting data as well as producing visualisations for clients, the challenges faced when deducing what kind of questions to ask from data and how I can improve upon that aspect and how to create visualisations that are accessible to all, including that with colour blindness in an easy to understand format.
